                Chris: Aright, welcome to the latest edition of Jobs to be Done
                Radio, I’m Chris Spiek. As
                always, I’m joined by Ervin Fowlkes and Bob Moesta. Hey guys.<p></p>
                <p>Bob: Hey Chris, how are you.</p>
                <p>Ervin: Hey Chris.</p>
                <p>Chris: Today, we have another special guest, Alan Klement is joining<br>
                    us. He is an<br>
                    engineer, software developer, author, if I have that right, big<br>
                    writer, and came up with the concept of the Jobs Story, which has<br>
                    taken the Jobs to be Done world by storm, and is being used by a lot<br>
                    of people. Alan, great to have you.</p>
                    <p>Alan: Great to be here, thank you.</p>
                    <p>Chris: So, why don’t we dive in a little bit. Give us a little bit of<br>
                        background, tell us about<br>
                        yourself, and lead us into what you do and how you came to discover<br>
                        Jobs, and learn about it, and what you were using before.</p>
                        <p>Alan: Great, absolutely. First off, let me just say that I am really<br>
                            thankful to you guys at Jobs-<br>
                            to-be-Done.org, and Clay Christensen, and everyone else in the<br>
                            community is really pushing the concept of Jobs-to-be-Done and<br>
                            popularizing it, because it’s really changed how I see<br>
                            entrepreneurship and product design, and marketing even.</p>
                            <p>A real quick thanks, these guys keep going with it. I’d love to talk<br>
                                to you any way I can.</p>
                                <p>Bob: Thanks.</p>
                                <p>Chris: Yes, we’re definitely excited to have your help, so Ervin was<br>
                                    just telling us before we<br>
                                    clicked record here that you’re going to be doing some writing for us<br>
                                    on the Jobs-to-be-Done.org blog, and I wanted to make sure that I<br>
                                    mentioned that, because I know that everybody who listens to this<br>
                                    podcast, most people also read the blog.</p>
                                    <p>I think that just knowing that is going to give people something to<br>
                                        look forward to. We’re actively reaching out to look forward to people<br>
                                        that are good writers and good communicators to add more fresh content<br>
                                        for the blog for people to read, and you’re definitely one of them.<br>
                                        So, that’s an exciting thing to look forward to.</p>
                                        <p>Bob: The thing is to think about how to collaborate on it. You don’t have<br>
                                            to just write it by<br>
                                            yourself, but if there’s things that you want to work on together, we<br>
                                            can do that as well. We can coordinate to do that.</p>
                                            <p>Ervin: The only qualifications out there to be a writer for Jobs-to-<br>
                                                be-Done.org blog is just,<br>
                                                step up and say “Hey, I love the theory. I love what you guys are<br>
                                                doing, and I just really want to participate in the community.” We<br>
                                                really believe in open source innovation, and anyone in a company can<br>
                                                make the choice to move their products forward, and we want to make<br>
                                                sure we’re there to help that along inertia.</p>
                                                <p>Chris: I got to set the bar a little higher, sorry Ervin. I think the<br>
                                                    other qualification is that you<br>
                                                    definitely need to demonstrate a fairly deep understanding of the<br>
                                                    framework.</p>
                                                    <p>The one thing that always makes our skin crawl is there are still<br>
                                                        groups of people out there saying, “The job of the TV is to entertain,<br>
                                                        and the job of the pen is to write,” and if you’re at that level that<br>
                                                        you need to do a little studying, and you need to do a little work<br>
                                                        before you start writing and spreading out the gospel, so to speak.</p>
                                                        <p>Bob: Tools and techniques. Tools and techniques to help you get to that<br>
                                                            next level. That’s a<br>
                                                            big thing. We’re in the midst of doing it quite a bit, and it’s one of<br>
                                                            those things we still have a hard time sharing output that we do, but<br>
                                                            it’s the frameworks.</p>
                                                            <p>To be honest, we’re almost, it’s hard to see. We don’t sense the water<br>
                                                                like a fish. The thing is, we do these frameworks, it’s all of a<br>
                                                                sudden, we need help, like what Alan did. Oh yes, the story. Doing<br>
                                                                things like the story, but never just formalize it. It’s awesome to<br>
                                                                have people like Alan out there who are helping us.</p>
                                                                <p>Chris: Great. So,</p>
                                                                <p>Alan: Sorry.</p>
                                                                <p>Chris: Go ahead.</p>
                                                                <p>Alan: I’m sorry, I sort of hijacked the question there. I wanted to say I<br>
                                                                    appreciate, because it<br>
                                                                    really has changed everything about how I approach that.</p>
                                                                    <p>Chris: Awesome.</p>
                                                                    <p>Alan: All right. Yes, so a quick about me is. I’ve been an engineer/hacker<br>
                                                                        most of my life,<br>
                                                                        and ever since probably twelve years old, I’ve been pumping out real<br>
                                                                        programs for fun. I’ve always been some kind of entrepreneur in some<br>
                                                                        way.</p>
                                                                        <p>I remember when I was really young, I was always trying to start<br>
                                                                            little businesses, just make a little money on the side, and even<br>
                                                                            today, I’m working with other engineers and other people, other<br>
                                                                            business people here in New York City to develop products.</p>
                                                                            <p>I really use Jobs-to-be-Done, that philosophy, in every aspect, from<br>
                                                                                market research, product discovery, customer development, and even<br>
                                                                                product design, which is kind of what thinking has brough me here to<br>
                                                                                this conversation with you guys. It was a lot of information out<br>
                                                                                there.</p>
                                                                                <p>I remember David, last week on the show talked about how, “Yes, Clay<br>
                                                                                    Christensen said some really great stuff, but he kind of glossed over<br>
                                                                                    some of these other things. I agree.</p>
                                                                                    <p>I think there’s one part in one of the Phoenix videos, Phoenix<br>
                                                                                        University videos, and Christensen says, “Oh, once you understand the<br>
                                                                                        job, then improving the product is relatively easy.” I’m like oh, I<br>
                                                                                        don’t know if it’s relatively easy. I think there’s a lot more there.</p>
                                                                                        <p>Chris: Yes. The interesting part is the dimension on which you have<br>
                                                                                            to improve becomes<br>
                                                                                            clear, right? I think, and for me to paraphrase or try to reword Clay<br>
                                                                                            is absurd, but I think when you’ve been in the muck around, we have<br>
                                                                                            something here that, a lot of times we talk to people.</p>
                                                                                            <p>We built a product, people are buying it, we’re not sure why they’re<br>
