                    <h2>Why Focus On Jobs?</h2>
                    <p>For a long time, anyone wanting to build and sell a successful product generally focused on customer attributes.</p>
                    <p>Demographic data were collected. Customer goals were defined. Desired outcomes were measured.</p> 
                    <p> Then, segments based on these data and attributes were created so customers could be organized into easy to reference categories. Even with these precise tools, some ¾ of products fail. For countless product designers and marketers, how to design products which don’t fail was a mystery - a black box sealed from the inside. Thinking in terms of Jobs allows product designers and marketers to open up that black box. When this happens, they have a better chance at not only making a successful product, but creating a business which competitors will find difficult to compete against.</p>

                    <p>Jobs to be Done is a tool for building better products of all types; be it software, consumer packaged goods or services.</p>

                    <p>It’s a tool to help product designers and bussinesses focus on understanding the energy and causal mechanisms which drive a consumer’s purchase decisions and the trade offs customers make as they struggle to achieve a desired outcome.</p>

It’s not about framing and segmenting customers by attributes such as age ranges, race, income and marital status. It’s also not about measuring and categorizing customers’ desired outcomes or goals.</p>

                    <h4>The Job</h4>

                    <p>A job is place where solutions can fit.  Much like how a question is a place waiting for answers to fit into.</p> 

                    <p>An example of job is:</p>

                    <p>Getting important documents, quickly and safely, from one place to another.</p>

                    <p>Solutions that were matched with this Job over time include:</br>The emperor of Rome hiring a courier, which rode across roads, fields and forests.</br>The mail service hiring a train. </br>A businessman hiring FedEx, which flies jet planes across the world.</p>
                    <p>Even though the job stayed the same for 2,000 years, the solution changed, becoming a better fit each time.</p>

                    <h4>Nonconsumption</h4>
                    <p>When customers want to make progress towards a particular outcome, but either fail or decide to stick with an existing solution.</p>

                    <p>Understanding consumption and when it does or doesn't happen is a critical part of knowing how to successfully apply Jobs-to-be-Done.</p>

                    <h4>Forces</h4>
                    <p>Almost every customer experiences emotional energy as they use, purchase and switch between products. This energy can be organized into Forces of progress and Forces of resistance.</p>
                    <p>Progress forces are the Push of the situation and the Pull of a new solution. </p>
                    <p>Forces of resistance are the Anxieties associated with switching to a new solution and their Habits associated with their current solution.</p>

                    <h1>Practices</h1>
                    <p>To help product designers use Jobs-to-be-Done for product design, specific practices have been created: Forces Diagram, Timeline and Jobs-to-be-Done interviews. </p>
                    <p>The key thing to remember with these practices is, these are tools for conversation - not deliverables which are highly refined. They are meant to help practitioners frame their thinking and provide a common language when communicating with co-workers or with other practitioners.</p>

                    <h3>JTBD Interviews</h3>
                    <p>There’s a particular style of customer interview which is associated with discovering and researching the Job To be Done for a product. Different from focus groups, Job Interviews are about interviewing customers one at a time. </p>
                    <p>These interviews usually last about an hour and during this time, product researchers are looking to understand what Job customers are trying to get done and how they are solving it now.</p>

                    <h3>Forces Diagram</h3>
                    <p>The Forces Diagram is a way to visualize and remember the forces that progress customers towards a new solution for a job and the forces which keep them using their existing solution(s) for a job. </p>
                    <p>When interviewing customers, the forces diagram is very helpful when a researcher is looking to uncover the causalities which did, or didn’t, lead to a purchase. </p>

                    <h3>Timeline</h3>
                    <p>The timeline is helpful in two ways:</p>

                    <p>1. During an interview, a researcher can use the timeline as a guide which helps them know which questions to ask and where to drive the interview.</br>
                        2. Timelines provide a way to find important events. As more customers' timelines are collected, researchers can begin to find similarites with the circumstances in which customers make decesions.</br>

                <h1>Similar But Different</h1>                    
                <p>JTBD is just a tool, which can be used with other tools. However it’s important to know how it different from similar frameworks & concepts. Here we look at few examples of how these frameworks are similar and different.</p>

                </div>
            </div>


            <div class="row featurette" id="about">
                <div class="col-md-6">

                    <h4>Goal-Directed Design</h4>
                    <p>First created by Alan Cooper, Goal-Directed Design is a particular approach to interaction design.  When most people think of this process, two concepts come to mind: Goals and Personas. 
                        Goals are defined as what motivates people to perform activities and are meant to help designers understand the expectations and aspirations of users. </p>

                        <p>Combined with Goals are Personas - customer abstractions based upon patterns observed during interviews with and observations of potential customers. When creating customers abstractions, if gaps are encountered, they are filled with supplemental research from Subject Matter Experts, stakeholders and available literature.  </p>

                        <p>At first, these two concepts may seem similar to Jobs; however, they are different in some very important ways. After over 20 years in the field and interviewing thousands of customers, Jobs-to-be-Done practitioners believe that abstracting customers into attribute influenced archetypes won’t give product teams the right information about customers. When it comes to Goals, it’s believed that customers are rarely able to correctly articulate what their true motivations and needs are in using or purchasing a product - asking them ‘why’ over and over again will likely lead you astray. 
                        </p>

                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <h4>Outcome-Driven Innovation</h4>
                        <p>Designed by Tony Ulwick, Outcome Driven Design is patented process which begins with market selection and then includes steps to uncover customer needs, determine which needs are unmet, formulate a growth strategy and devise and evaluate product and service concepts<sup>1</sup>.</p> 
                        <p>It suggets that customers can articulate their needs and that the needs can be captured. Furthermore, these needs which are captured should then fed into an 'opportunity algorithm' which determines the best oppertunites for growth. These customer captures needs form the primary unit of analysis to estabilsh a Job-to-be-Done.<sup>2</sup>.</p>

                        <p>The biggest similarity between Outcome-Driven Innovation and Jobs-to-be-Done is that both believe that sucessfull products are born from understanding a customer's job to be done. Beyond that, both have a very different opinions on how to understand and define what a customer's job-to-be-done is.</p>

                        <p>Outcome-Driven Innocation is a structured process which promotes a meticulous gathering and measuring of customer needs and expected outcomes. </p>

                        <p>The Jobs-to-be-Done framework sees itself as less a process and more as a tool. A tool which helps product designers understand consumption and how customers make decisions when faced with a particular situation. It encourages organizations to use this information to make their own processes better by applying the principles and practices detailed above.</p>
