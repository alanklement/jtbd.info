				<p>When deciding what to hire for a Job, customers evaluate the options avalable to them. They are also thinking about the trade offs associated with each solution, as well as the trade offs they are willing to make.</p>

				<p>This is when customers build a Consideration Set.</p>

				<p>If their Job is to satisfy their hunger, they may consider a pizza...but also a deli sandwich, a burrito, sushi, or even nothing - preferring to wait for another opportunity to eat.</p>
