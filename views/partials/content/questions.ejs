				<p>Every time someone makes a purchase, itâ€™s because some situation has arisen in their lives which they want to solve.</p>

				<p>That's what a <span class="hot plus-125 jtbd-font-00">Job</span> is: it's a situation which a customer is trying to resolve.</p>
				<p>To get their Jobs done, customers usually need something, some product, to help them. <span class="jtbd-font-700">Discovering</span> what Job the customer is trying to get done, <span class="jtbd-font-700">understanding</span> how they make decisions and <span class="jtbd-font-700">applying</span> this knowledge to sell and create products is why the Jobs-to-be-Done framework was created.</p>
