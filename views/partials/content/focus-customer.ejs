				<h2>Why Not Focus On The Customer?</h2>
				<p>Traditionaly, anyone wanting to build and sell a successful product generally focused on the customer themself.</p>
				
				<p class="lead text-center">Demographic data were collected. <br>Customer goals were defined. <br>Desired outcomes were measured.</p>
				
				<p>Then, segments based on these data and attributes were created so customers could be organized into easy to reference categories. Even with these precise tools and extensive data, some ¾ of products fail.</p>

				<p>For countless product designers and marketers, how to design & sell products which don’t fail is a mystery - a black box sealed from the inside.</p>

				<h2>Shifting Focus To The Job</h2>
				<p>The solution: an understanding that customers don't buy products because of who there, but rather because they have a job to get done.</p>
				<p>When thinking shifts from focusing on customer attributes and goals, to understanding a customer’s job to be done, it allows product designers and marketers to open up that black box. </p>
				<p>When this happens, they have a better chance at not only making & selling a successful product, but creating a business which competitors will find difficult to compete against.</p>
