		<h2>Focus On The Job, Not The Customer</h2>
		<p>For a long time, anyone wanting to build and sell a successful product generally focused on the customer themself.</p>
		
		<p>Demographic data were collected. Customer goals were defined. Desired outcomes were measured.</p>
		
		<p>Then, segments based on these data and attributes were created so customers could be organized into easy to reference categories. Even with these precise tools and extensive data , some ¾ of products fail. For countless product designers and marketers, how to design products which don’t fail was a mystery - a black box sealed from the inside.</p>

		<p>When thinking shifts from focusing on customer attributes and goals, to understanding a customer’s job to be done, it allows product designers and marketers to open up that black box. When this happens, they have a better chance at not only making a successful product, but creating a business which competitors will find difficult to compete against.</p>
