				<p>The Jobs-to-be-Done framework starts with the the idea that customers buy products, not because of the type of person they are, but because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84LymEs67Y" target="_blank">they have a job to do</a>.</p>

				<p>Building upon that, in two big ways, it help us create better products:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Suggests principals and practices so we understand the context surrounding customers as they buy products, use them and after they use them.</p></li>
					<li><p>After understanding a customer's <span class="hot">Job</span> and it's context, the framework helps us translate these understandings into marketing and product design decisions.</p></li>
				</ul>
