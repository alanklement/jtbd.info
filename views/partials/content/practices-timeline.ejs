				<p>The timeline is an illustration of the keys events which someone experienced while on their journey to buying (or coming close to buying ) a product. It’s helpful in two ways:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>During an interview, a researcher can use the timeline as a guide which helps them know which questions to ask and where to drive the interview.</li>
					<li>Timelines provide a way to find important events. As more customers' timelines are collected, researchers can begin to find similarities with the circumstances in which customers make decisions.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>When interviewing customers, the forces diagram is very helpful when a researcher is looking to uncover the causalities which did, or didn’t, lead to a purchase.</p>

				<p>Marketing and products teams can also use the timeline to know how, and when, to reach out to customers.</p>

				<p>The timeline is also a key component in the JTBD framework.</p>
