		<h1>The Switch</h1>
		<p>The switch is a specific event that applies to many circumstances. The switch is what happens when customers stick with a job, but fire one solution and hire another.</p>
		<p>An example of a switch is someone who faces the job of solving their hunger in a quick and easy manner. If they had a habit of hiring pizza to get the job done, but then decides they wanted a more healthy solution to the job, they may fire the pizza and hire sushi.</p> 
		<p>This is the Switch. Itâ€™s when someone fired one solution ( pizza ) and hired another ( sushi ) to get the same job done ( solving their hunger in a quick and easy manner ).</p>
