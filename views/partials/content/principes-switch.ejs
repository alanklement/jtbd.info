				<p>Our customer, so far, has been searching for and using a product for a Job: solving hunger in a quick and easy manner</p>

				<p>For some time, they had the habit of hiring pizza for their job; however, at some point, they reevaluated their consideration set and made a change. They fired pizza and hired sushi.</p> 

				<p>This is the Switch. Itâ€™s when someone fires one solution and hires another to get the same, or similar, job done.</p>
